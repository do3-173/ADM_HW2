    "Assume you are working as a librarian at a public library in Rome. Some new books have arrived, and you are in charge of putting them on a shelf. Your supervisor will give you some instructions, and you will follow his. Each book has a unique ID, and your boss's instructions can be of the following types: \n",

    "- **? N** - Calculate the minimum number of books you must pop from the left or right to have the book with ID = N as the leftmost or rightmost book on the shelf.\n",

    "\"Let's analyze the time complexity of your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code uses a deque (double-ended queue) from the collections module. Appending or appending left to a deque has an amortized time complexity of O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The code iterates through each instruction in the 'instructions' list, and for each instruction, it performs some operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the instruction is 'R' or 'L', you perform a single append or appendleft operation, which is O(1).\n",
    "- If the instruction is '?', you have a for loop that iterates over approximately half of the elements in the 'library'. In the worst case, you check two elements for a match. This loop has a time complexity of O(N/2) = O(N), where N is the number of elements in the 'library'.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the overall time complexity of your 'library_calculation' function can be approximated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "O(M) * (O(1) + O(1) + O(N)) = O(M + M*N)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- M is the number of instructions in the 'instructions' list.\n",
    "- N is the number of elements in the 'library'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dominant term in the time complexity is O(M*N) because for each '?' instruction, you perform O(N) operations in the worst case. So, the time complexity of your code is O(M*N).\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that this analysis assumes worst-case scenarios and that the actual execution time may vary based on the specific input data and how often the '?' instructions are encountered.\""

    "1. Appending is the O(1) operation, with the deque it does not matter if it is from the left or right it still is O(1). This is correct\n",
    "2. Mainly we will analyze this calculation:\n",
    "O(M) * (O(1) + O(1) + O(N)) = O(M + M*N).\n",
    "If the M is the number of instructions, first O(1) is taking the element from iterations. Second one is append, which in deque is always O(1), which is confirmed above. O(N) is the complexity of running through the number of elements in the library and N is the number of elements in the library.\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The algorithm detailed in (1.) is suboptimal, particularly due to its potential \\(O(N^2)\\) time complexity when the '?' instruction is frequent. The inefficiency lies in the search operation for the '?' instruction. As it iterates over the deque, the worst-case scenario can drive the time complexity up to quadratic.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more efficient strategy involves integrating both a deque and a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deque**: Maintains the sequence of elements.\n",
    "- **Dictionary**: Holds each number as a key, with its corresponding index in the deque as the value. \n",
    "\n",
    "This hybrid approach allows for an \\(O(1)\\) time complexity during search operations. However, a potential \\(O(N^2)\\) time complexity may arise if the 'R' or 'L' instruction is predominant, depending on the instruction that is chosen to update positions if the shift is on the left or right.\n",
    "\n",
    "For demonstration, the algorithm is implemented below. It leverages both the deque and dictionary. Instruction 'L' is chosen where there's a need to update positions for all books due to the shift caused by appending on the left. The execution times for both the original algorithm and algorithm with dictionary have been benchmarked using the `time` library.\n"
