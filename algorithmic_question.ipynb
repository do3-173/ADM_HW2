    "Assume you are working as a librarian at a public library in Rome. Some new books have arrived, and you are in charge of putting them on a shelf. Your supervisor will give you some instructions, and you will follow his. Each book has a unique ID, and your boss's instructions can be of the following types: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **L N** - place the book with ID = N on the shelf to the left of the leftmost existing book\n",
    "- **R N** - place the book with ID = N on the shelf to the right of the rightmost existing book\n",
    "- **? N** - Calculate the minimum number of books you must pop from the left or right to have the book with ID = N as the leftmost or rightmost book on the shelf.\n",
    "  \n",
    "You must follow your boss's instructions and report the answers to type 3 instructions to him. He guarantees that if he has a type 3 instruction for a book with a specific ID, the book has already been placed on the shelf. \n",
